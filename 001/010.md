# The absence of ownership validation in the ``permit`` function
## Summary
The security vulnerability involves the absence of ownership validation in the ``permit`` function within the source code, allowing any user to delegate control of an NFT without verifying their ownership.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the ``permit`` function, there is no check to confirm whether the caller is the actual owner of the NFT. As a result, anyone can call this function for any NFT without verifying their ownership. This lack of ownership validation may lead to unauthorized delegation and potential security issues.

## Impact
- Risk of unauthorized delegation of NFT ownership to non-owners.
- Potential manipulation or misuse of NFTs, which could result in financial losses for users.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/PermitERC721.sol#L142-L166

```solidity
function permit(
    address spender_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 deadline_,
    bytes memory signature_
) external {
    // ...
    
    // approve the spender for accessing the tokenId
    _approve(spender_, tokenId_);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is crucial to validate the ownership of the NFT by the caller before allowing them to delegate control. Implement checks to ensure that only the actual owners of NFTs can delegate permission to prevent unauthorized delegation and potential security risks.

```solidity
function permit(
    address spender_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 deadline_,
    bytes memory signature_
) external {
    // Check that the permit's deadline hasn't passed
    if (block.timestamp > deadline_) revert PermitExpired();

    // Check that the caller is the owner of the tokenId
    require(msg.sender == ownerOf(tokenId_), "Not the owner");

    .....
    // Approve the spender for accessing the tokenId
    _approve(spender_, tokenId_);
```
