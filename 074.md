# Wrong revert condition in transferLP
## Summary
Approved new LP owner failed to transfer the LPs to his address. 

## Vulnerability Detail
If newOwnerAddress_ == msg.sender, then the latter condition failed and revert the transfer.

## Impact

## Code Snippet
[LPActions.sol#L217-L218](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LPActions.sol#L217-L218)
```solidity
transferLP():
217:        // revert if msg.sender is not the new owner and is not approved as a transferor by the new owner
218:        if (newOwnerAddress_ != msg.sender && !approvedTransferors_[newOwnerAddress_][msg.sender]) revert TransferorNotApproved();
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the revert condition in L218 to:
```solidity
if (newOwnerAddress_ != msg.sender || !approvedTransferors_[ownerAddress_][newOwnerAddress_]) revert TransferorNotApproved();
```
