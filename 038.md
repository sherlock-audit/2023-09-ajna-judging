# Unremoved Collateralized Loans After Take Action causes Bad Debts
## Summary

- collateralized loans are not removed from the auction after a `take` action. This oversight leads to increased bad debts, impacting borrowers , higher bucket lenders, and the protocol reserve, causing unnecessary losses.

## Vulnerability Detail

- If a loan becomes collateralized in the liquidation process (`take` action), this loan should be removed from the auction to avoid bad debts. In fact, that's what the _white paper_ stated:
  > Because the only remaining deposit is Alice’s at 1000, the LUP is now 1000. The loan is fully collateralized with respect to this LUP so the loan’s auction ends, but the loan remains active.

_However_, that's not the case in the code. When a `bucketTake` or `take` happens, there is no check after this action to determine if the loan has become healthy, and if so, remove it. This makes it more likely for bad debts to accrue in the pool.

- Consider the following scenario:

  - Bob has a debt of `1000 QT` and `10 CL`, so Bob's _TP_ = 1000/10 = `100`.
  - A lender wants to withdraw his deposit. So, they kicked Bob's loan, and the `LUP` calculated  becomes `90`.
  - When the price of Bob's loan becomes `150 QT/CL`, Alice makes a `take` with `300 QT` and gets `2 CL`.
  - Now Bob's loan TP is: 700/8 = `87.5`, which is less than the current LUP (LUP, by the way, can be way higher if other lenders deposit or borrowers repay their loans..ect). now the loan is collateralized with respect to `LUP`

- Bob's loan does not get removed from the auction in this case , adding additional risk to the protocol by staying in the auction. Let's continue the example:
  - Now some time has passed, and the auction price is `50 QT/CL`.
  - Alice found some additional QT and goes back to buy more CL. It buys all possible debt: `400 QT` and gets `8 CL`.
  - Now Bob has `300 QT` debt and `0 COL`.and the auction need to be settled.
  > NOTICE that the debts in auction are included in the calculation of the `LUP`.

## Impact

- Bob, higher buckets lenders, and the protocol reserve all suffer losses in the settlement of such bad debts, while it should have been avoided.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

in the [\_takeLoan](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L200) function. consider to check if the `TP` of the borrower less then `lup`. if so remove the borrower from auction.
