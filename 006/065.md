# A bucket is only bankrupted if it has 0 collateral and 0 deposit after settlement. This can be exploited by an attacker
## Summary
The vulnerability is that currently, a bucket is only bankrupted if it has 0 collateral and 0 deposit after settlement. An attacker could exploit this by:
1. Precisely removing all the collateral from a bucket, leaving it with 0 collateral but non-zero deposit.
2. Since the bucket is not bankrupt yet, settlement will remove deposit from this bucket to settle debt.
3. After settlement, the bucket will have 0 collateral and 0 deposit, so it gets bankrupted.
4. However, before settlement, the attacker borrowed against the non-zero deposit in this bucket with 0 collateral. This allowed the attacker to get a loan without proper collateral backing.

## Vulnerability Detail
The key parts of the code related to this vulnerability are:
1. _settlePoolDebtWithDeposit removes deposit from a bucket to settle debt. It checks if the bucket should be bankrupted after removing deposit:

          // Remove deposit used to settle debt 
          Deposits.unscaledRemove(deposits_, vars.index, vars.unscaledDeposit);

          // Check if bucket should be bankrupted
          if (vars.hpbCollateral == 0 && vars.hpbUnscaledDeposit == 0 && vars.hpbLP != 0) {
            // Bankrupt bucket 
           }

2. A bucket is bankrupted only if it has 0 collateral and 0 deposit:

          if (vars.hpbCollateral == 0 && vars.hpbUnscaledDeposit == 0 && vars.hpbLP != 0) {
            // Bankrupt bucket
          }

The vulnerability is:
• Attacker borrows against a bucket with 0 collateral but non-zero deposit. This loan is undercollateralized.
• In settlement, deposit will be removed from this bucket to settle the attacker's debt.
• After settlement, the bucket will have 0 collateral and 0 deposit, satisfying the condition to be bankrupted.
• However, the attacker already benefited by getting an undercollateralized loan before settlement.

Let me walk through an example exploit scenario:
1. Attacker borrows 1 ETH against a bucket that has 1 ETH collateral and 10 DAI deposit.
2. Attacker removes the 1 ETH collateral from the bucket, leaving it with 0 collateral but still 10 DAI deposit.
3. Attacker borrows 10 more DAI against the remaining 10 DAI deposit in the now 0 collateral bucket.
4. Later, when the attacker's debt is settled, the 10 DAI deposit will be removed from the bucket to repay the debt.
5. Now the bucket has 0 collateral and 0 deposit, so it gets bankrupted.
6. However, the attacker already borrowed an extra 10 DAI in step 3 that was not properly collateralized.
The key vulnerabilities in the code enabling this attack:
• `_settlePoolDebtWithDeposit` only checks for 0 collateral and 0 deposit AFTER settlement to bankrupt a bucket. It does not check for improper collateralization BEFORE settlement.
• `Buckets.addCollateral` allows adding collateral against deposit in a 0 collateral bucket. It does not check that collateralization ratio is maintained.


## Impact
It allows attackers to take out undercollateralized loans by manipulating the collateral in buckets right before settlement.
The severity is high because this undermines the core collateralization mechanisms and risk model of the lending protocol. Specifically:
• Attackers can take loans with little to no collateral, putting them in a risky position where they have incentive to default strategically.
• When attackers default, the protocol takes losses since the loans were undercollateralized. This could lead to loss of user funds.
• Other users may unknowingly deposit assets into the manipulated buckets thinking they are properly collateralized, when in fact their deposits are backing attacker loans.
• The faulty collateral checks break the trust in the protocol's risk model and incentives.
Overall I would classify this as a critical severity issue since it allows attackers to break the core collateralization logic and take risky undercollateralized loans. This directly threatens user funds and the sustainability of the protocol. The code should be updated to properly check for and prevent these manipulation attacks

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
A suggestion would be:
In `Buckets.addCollateral`, add a check that the collateral/deposit ratio stays within proper bounds after adding collateral. Reject if current collateral is 0.
In `_settlePoolDebtWithDeposit`, before settlement, check if any buckets with non-zero deposit have 0 collateral. If so, bankrupt those buckets first before settlement.
This ensures buckets are properly collateralized at all times, preventing the attack described above. The key is to validate collateralization in real-time, not just after settlement.
