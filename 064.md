# Removing collateral does not always update the position's `npToTp` ratio
## Summary

Functions that remove collateral do not update the borrower's `npToTp` ratio, which may lead to miscalculations of the neutral price, as well as auction's reference price and bond size. 

## Vulnerability Detail

One of the key properties of borrowers is their NP/TP ratio. This is tracked in the [`npTpRatio` field of the `Borrower` struct](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/interfaces/pool/commons/IPoolState.sol#L386). According to [its documention](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/interfaces/pool/commons/IPoolState.sol#L386), the `npTpRatio` should always return the value "at the time of last borrow or pull collateral". This is also supported by the protocol's whitepaper, where it states that "[The TP/NP Ratio] is recomputed every time the borrower draws more debt, or removes collateral".

In the code, the `npTpRatio` variable is updated in [the `Loans::update` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Loans.sol#L72). For example, it's executed when [drawing](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol#L194) or [repaying](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol#L313) debt, when [stamping loans](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol#L365) or when [taken auctioned loans are updated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/TakerActions.sol#L542).

However, the protocol does not update the `npTpRatio` when a borrower removes collateral from its position ([see `LenderActions::removeCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/LenderActions.sol#L485)). This means that the `npTpRatio` of a borrower may become outdated after removing collateral.

## Impact

This may become problematic in actions following the removal of collateral that use the outdated `npTpRatio` value. For example, a kick reads both from the borrower's `collateral` and the `npTpRatio` of a borrower [to calculate the neutral price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/KickerActions.sol#L310-L314). Yet if the `npTpRatio` wasn't updated before, the calculation could be using an incorrect value and lead to miscalulation of the neutral price. Which would then affect the calculations of the [auction's reference price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/KickerActions.sol#L319) and the [kicker's bond](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/87abfb6a9150e5df3819de58cbd972a66b3b50e3/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/KickerActions.sol#L321-L325).

## Recommendation

Update all functions that remove collateral from the protocol to make sure they correctly call `Loans::update` to update the `npTpRatio` of the borrower.
