# Initialization of an ERC20Pool contract can be frontrun
## Summary

An ERC20Pool contract uses an initialize function instead of a constructor to init states of the contract. However, the initialize function does not verify a `msg.sender` who calls this function. The mistake leads to a vulnerability of frontrunning while deploying the contract on mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `ERC20Pool` contract at [line 86](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L86), an `initialize` function uses for set values for states of the contract and a `rate_` parameter is passed.

Although the function cannot be called at the second time. But, the function does not check for the `msg.sender` who can call them. A transaction to initialize them can be front-run and the front-runner can arbitrarily set the `rate_` parameter.

## Impact
A transaction to initialize them can be front-run and the front-runner can arbitrarily set the `rate_` parameter. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function initialize(
        uint256 rate_
    ) external override {
        if (isPoolInitialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();

        inflatorState.inflator       = uint208(1e18);
        inflatorState.inflatorUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

        interestState.interestRate       = uint208(rate_);
        interestState.interestRateUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

        Loans.init(loans);

        // increment initializations count to ensure these values can't be updated
        isPoolInitialized = true;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adding an `onlyOwner()` modifier to the `initialize` function.
