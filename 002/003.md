# Initialization of an ERC721Pool contract can be frontrun
## Summary

An ERC721Pool contract uses an initialize function instead of a constructor to init states of the contract. However, the initialize function does not verify a `msg.sender` who calls this function. The mistake leads to a vulnerability of frontrunning while deploying the contract on mainnet.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `ERC721Pool` contract at [line 88](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L88), an `initialize` function uses for set values for states of the contract and a `tokenIds_` and a `rate_` parameters are passed.

Although the function cannot be called at the second time. But, the function does not check for the `msg.sender` who can call them. A transaction to initialize them can be front-run and the front-runner can arbitrarily set the `tokenIds_` and `rate_` parameters.

## Impact

A transaction to initialize them can be front-run and the front-runner can arbitrarily set the `tokenIds_` and `rate_` parameters. 

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function initialize(
        uint256[] memory tokenIds_,
        uint256 rate_
    ) external override {
        if (isPoolInitialized) revert AlreadyInitialized();

        inflatorState.inflator       = uint208(1e18);
        inflatorState.inflatorUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

        interestState.interestRate       = uint208(rate_);
        interestState.interestRateUpdate = uint48(block.timestamp);

        uint256 noOfTokens = tokenIds_.length;

        if (noOfTokens != 0) {
            // add subset of tokenIds allowed in the pool
            for (uint256 id = 0; id < noOfTokens;) {
                tokenIdsAllowed_[tokenIds_[id]] = true;

                unchecked { ++id; }
            }
        }

        Loans.init(loans);

        // increment initializations count to ensure these values can't be updated
        isPoolInitialized = true;
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Adding an `onlyOwner()` modifier to the `initialize` function.
