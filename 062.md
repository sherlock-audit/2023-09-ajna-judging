# Rounding of collateral amounts in _settleAuction can lead to a loss of collateral value over time
## Summary
Calculations like remainingCollateral and compensatedCollateral round the collateral amounts down. This causes a loss of collateral value over time. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The _settleAuction function floors the borrower's collateral to the nearest WAD (1e18) when settling ERC-721 auctions:

      remainingCollateral_ = (borrowerCollateral_ / Maths.WAD) * Maths.WAD;

This means any fractional amount of collateral less than 1 WAD will be rounded down and lost.

For example, if a borrower had 1.5 WAD of collateral, after rounding it would become 1 WAD. So 0.5 WAD of collateral value is lost.

The compensatedCollateral is also rounded:

      compensatedCollateral_ = borrowerCollateral_ - remainingCollateral_;

So in the example above, the compensatedCollateral would be 0.5 WAD. But when this collateral is deposited into a bucket, it will be rounded down again.

Over many auctions, these small amounts of lost collateral can add up to a significant total loss of value.
## Impact
It can lead to a slow drain of collateral value from the lending pool over time.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 The rounding could be removed and fractional amounts of collateral could be retained. A suggestive example:


      remainingCollateral_ = borrowerCollateral_; 

      uint256 fractionalCollateral = borrowerCollateral_ % Maths.WAD;

      if (fractionalCollateral > 0) {
        // deposit fractional amount into bucket
        // update compensatedCollateral
      }

This retains the full collateral value without rounding and loss. The fractional amounts can be handled by the bucket deposits.
