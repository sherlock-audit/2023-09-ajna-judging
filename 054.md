# Loan with 0 threshold price can be inserted into the loans heap. This can break the max heap property
## Summary
ZeroThresholdPrice error check only occurs when updating an existing loan, not on insert. This could allow a loan with 0 threshold price to be inserted.
## Vulnerability Detail
It is possible for a loan with 0 threshold price to be inserted into the loans heap. This is because the ZeroThresholdPrice error check only occurs in the update() function when updating an existing loan, not on initial insert.
Here is how a 0 threshold price loan could get inserted:
• The init() function initializes the heap with a dummy node, but does no threshold price checks:

      function init(LoansState storage loans_) internal {
        loans_.loans.push(Loan(address(0), 0)); 
      }
• The update() function only does a threshold price check when updating an existing loan:

      If (t0ThresholdPrice == 0) revert ZeroThresholdPrice();
• But on first insert of a new loan, it calls _upsert() which can insert without a threshold price check:

      _upsert(loans_, borrowerAddress_, loanId, uint96(t0ThresholdPrice));

So if `t0ThresholdPrice` is 0 on first insert, it will get added to the heap.
This can break the max heap property and allow `getMax()` to return loans with 0 threshold price. It could also lead to errors in the bubbling logic that assumes children have <= threshold price than parents.

## Impact
The vulnerability of allowing a loan with 0 threshold price to be inserted into the loans heap is that it could break the max heap property. Overall this seems like a high severity issue as it violates a core data structure invariant that much of the logic depends on. Allowing 0 threshold price loans to ever be inserted, even if just on initialization, could create hard to trace bugs and heap corruption down the line

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
the _upsert() function could also be changed to check for 0 threshold price on insert:

      function _upsert(/*...*/) internal {

        if (thresholdPrice_ == 0) {
          revert ZeroThresholdPrice(); 
        }

        // rest of upsert logic
      }

This would prevent a 0 threshold price loan from ever entering the heap, whether on insert or update, maintaining the heap invariants.
