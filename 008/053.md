# Use safetransferfrom and safetransfer for ERC20 and ERC721
## Summary
Use safetransferfrom and safetransfer instead of transfer and transferfrom
## Vulnerability Detail
The transferFrom() and transfer method is used instead of safeTransferFrom() and safetransfer, presumably to save gas. I however argue that this isn’t recommended because:

[OpenZeppelin’s documentation](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#IERC721-transferFrom-address-address-uint256-) discourages the use of transferFrom(), use safeTransferFrom() whenever possible.

## Impact
The contract will malfunction for certain tokens.

## Recommendation
Call the safeTransferFrom() and safetransfer() method instead of transferFrom() and transfer
