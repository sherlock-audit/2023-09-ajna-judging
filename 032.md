# prefixSum  turn into an infinite loop when the check condition is true
## Summary
Within the `prefixSum` function in the Deposits library, there exists a vulnerability leading to a potential infinite loop. Specifically, the issue arises when the condition `curIndex > SIZE` becomes true.
## Vulnerability Detail
- function : **prefixSum()**
- source : `src/libraries/internal/Deposits.sol : Deposits ` library</br>
  The issue lies in the following code segment:

```solidity
while (j >= indexLSB) {
    curIndex = index + j;
  if (curIndex > SIZE) {
        // Skip the rest of the loop body for this iteration
        continue;
    }

    // Code here will be skipped for curIndex > SIZE

    // Update loop variables and check the loop condition for the next iteration
    j = j >> 1;
}
```

- The variable `indexLSB` is catched outside the loop so it's remains constant, while `j` is shifted right in each iteration `(j = j >> 1;)`.
```solidity
 function prefixSum(
        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        uint256 sumIndex_
    ) internal view returns (uint256 sum_) {
        // price buckets are indexed starting at 0, Fenwick bit logic is more elegant starting at 1
        ++sumIndex_;

        uint256 runningScale = Maths.WAD; // Tracks scale(index_) as we move down Fenwick tree
        uint256 j            = SIZE;      // bit that iterates from MSB to LSB
        uint256 index        = 0;         // build up sumIndex bit by bit

     uint256 indexLSB = lsb(sumIndex_);
        uint256 curIndex;

        while (j >= indexLSB) {
            curIndex = index + j;
            // Skip considering indices outside bounds of Fenwick tree
            if (curIndex > SIZE) continue;
            //.......
            //.......

            // shift j to consider next less signficant bit
         j = j >> 1;
        }
    }
```

- In this segment, if `curIndex` becomes greater than `SIZE`, the loop variables `index` and `j` remain constant. The right shift operation on `j` (`j = j >> 1;`) intended to reach the termination condition `(j >= indexLSB)` will never be executed. Consequently, `curIndex` will remain the same in each iteration, always exceeding the `SIZE` limit. As a result, the `continue` statement will be perpetually triggered, causing the loop to run endlessly. This scenario leads to an infinite loop, consuming all available gas without making any progress toward the termination condition `(j >= indexLSB)`. This situation creates a potential denial-of-service scenario and causes users to lose funds due to excessive gas fees.
## Impact
- the `accrueInterest` function,will always revert in this case. which is called in almost every user action from the protocol.wich break the system.
- Significant amount of gas fee will be payed by the caller.
## Code Snippet
- the [prefixSum](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Deposits.sol#L239C4-L239C9) function :

```solidity

        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        uint256 sumIndex_
    ) internal view returns (uint256 sum_) {
        // price buckets are indexed starting at 0, Fenwick bit logic is more elegant starting at 1
        ++sumIndex_;

        uint256 runningScale = Maths.WAD; // Tracks scale(index_) as we move down Fenwick tree
        uint256 j            = SIZE;      // bit that iterates from MSB to LSB
        uint256 index        = 0;         // build up sumIndex bit by bit

        // Used to terminate loop.  We don't need to consider final 0 bits of sumIndex_
        uint256 indexLSB = lsb(sumIndex_);
        uint256 curIndex;

        while (j >= indexLSB) {
            curIndex = index + j;

            // Skip considering indices outside bounds of Fenwick tree
            if (curIndex > SIZE) continue;

            // We are considering whether to include node index + j in the sum or not.  Either way, we need to scaling[index + j],
            // either to increment sum_ or to accumulate in runningScale
            uint256 scaled = deposits_.scaling[curIndex];

            if (sumIndex_ & j != 0) {
                // node index + j of tree is included in sum
                uint256 value = deposits_.values[curIndex];

                // Accumulate in sum_, recall that scaled==0 means that the scale factor is actually 1
                sum_  += scaled != 0 ? Math.mulDiv(
                    runningScale * scaled,
                    value,
                    1e36
                ) : Maths.wmul(runningScale, value);

                // Build up index bit by bit
                index = curIndex;

                // terminate if we've already matched sumIndex_
                if (index == sumIndex_) break;
            } else {
                // node is not included in sum, but its scale needs to be included for subsequent sums
                if (scaled != 0) runningScale = Maths.floorWmul(runningScale, scaled);
            }
            // shift j to consider next less signficant bit
            j = j >> 1;
        }
    }

## Recommendation
- update `J` before you skip in case  `curIndex > SIZE`.

```sol
    function prefixSum(
        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        uint256 sumIndex_
    ) internal view returns (uint256 sum_) {
        // price buckets are indexed starting at 0, Fenwick bit logic is more elegant starting at 1
        ++sumIndex_;

        uint256 runningScale = Maths.WAD; // Tracks scale(index_) as we move down Fenwick tree
        uint256 j            = SIZE;      // bit that iterates from MSB to LSB
        uint256 index        = 0;         // build up sumIndex bit by bit

        // Used to terminate loop.  We don't need to consider final 0 bits of sumIndex_
        uint256 indexLSB = lsb(sumIndex_);
        uint256 curIndex;
    while (j >= indexLSB) {
            curIndex = index + j;

            // Skip considering indices outside bounds of Fenwick tree
            if (curIndex > SIZE) {
          j = j >> 1;
            continue;}

            // We are considering whether to include node index + j in the sum or not.  Either way, we need to scaling[index + j],
            // either to increment sum_ or to accumulate in runningScale
            uint256 scaled = deposits_.scaling[curIndex];

            if (sumIndex_ & j != 0) {
                // node index + j of tree is included in sum
                uint256 value = deposits_.values[curIndex];

                // Accumulate in sum_, recall that scaled==0 means that the scale factor is actually 1
                sum_  += scaled != 0 ? Math.mulDiv(
                    runningScale * scaled,
                    value,
                    1e36

                index = curIndex;

                // terminate if we've already matched sumIndex_
                if (index == sumIndex_) break;
            } else {
                // node is not included in sum, but its scale needs to be included for subsequent sums
                if (scaled != 0) runningScale = Maths.floorWmul(runningScale, scaled);
            }
            // shift j to consider next less signficant bit
            j = j >> 1;
        }
    }
