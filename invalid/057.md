# Use "safeTransferFrom" instead of "transferFrom" for ERC721

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use of the transferFrom method for ERC721 transfer is discouraged and recommended to use safeTransferFrom whenever possible by OpenZeppelin.
This is because transferFrom() cannot check whether the receiving address knows how to handle ERC721 tokens.

In the function shown below PoC, the ERC721 token is sent to the address(to)  with the transferFrom method.
If this address (to)  is a contract and is not aware of incoming ERC721 tokens, the sent token could be locked up in the contract forever.

        IERC721Token(_getArgAddress(COLLATERAL_ADDRESS)).transferFrom(from_, to_, tokenId_);
