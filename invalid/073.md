# PoolInfoUtils::`poolReservesInfo()`: L279 - Time Manipulation Risk - Potential `block.timestamp` exploitation to artificially reduce `timeRemaining_` of auction, resulting in an unexpected & invalid shortening of the auction duration.
## Summary

PoolInfoUtils::poolReservesInfo(): L279 - Time Manipulation Risk - Potential block.timestamp exploitation to artificially reduce timeRemaining_ of auction, resulting in an unexpected & invalid shortening of the auction duration.

Manipulating the value of `block.timestamp` by delaying the inclusion of transaction into a block, will inevitably result in an unexpected & arguable invalid shortening of the auction's remaining time, violating at least one protocol invariant

## Vulnerability Detail

PoC:

L279 from below function:
```solidity
timeRemaining_              = 3 days - Maths.min(3 days, block.timestamp - auctionKickTime);
```
Lets say the non-manipulated timestamp value results in `block.timestamp - auctionKickTime == 2 days`, leaving 1 day left for the auction, but due to manipulation by rogue miners/validators the manipulated timestamp produces `block.timestamp - auctionKickTime == 3 days`, which leaves 0 days left for the auction.

## Impact

This discrepancy between the non-manipulated and manipulated timestamps can lead to a host of unexpected issues that may adversely affect various participants within the DeFi ecosystem, including lenders, borrowers, and their earnings, as well as trust in the protocol.

## Code Snippet

`poolReservesInfo()`:
```solidity
    /**
     *  @notice Returns info related to `Claimaible Reserve Auction`.
     *  @param  ajnaPool_                   Address of `Ajna` pool.
     *  @return reserves_                   The amount of excess quote tokens.
     *  @return claimableReserves_          Denominated in quote token, or `0` if no reserves can be auctioned.
     *  @return claimableReservesRemaining_ Amount of claimable reserves which has not yet been taken.
     *  @return auctionPrice_               Current price at which `1` quote token may be purchased, denominated in `Ajna`.
     *  @return timeRemaining_              Seconds remaining before takes are no longer allowed.

Implement checks, not exactly sure what type of checks, need to think about it.
