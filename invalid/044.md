## Summary:Division before multiplication would result in rounding errors

## Vulnerability Detail:The functions repayDebt() and drawDebt() implements a method _roundToScale(), this function is to thwart dust amount when borrowing debt or repaying a debt.This function would round amount to zero when dealing with Quote || Collateral Tokens which has decimals less than 9. 

The implementation of the function : 

function _roundToScale( 

uint256 amount_, 

uint256 tokenScale_ 

) pure returns (uint256 scaledAmount_) { 

scaledAmount_ = (amount_ / tokenScale_) * tokenScale_; 

} 

 The token Scale of any token is defined as :10**(18-decimal) 

For example, the token Scale for the Ethereum USDC is 10**12, to scale the amount and due to the fact that solidity  rounds decimals down to the nearest whole number, When computing the scale it would yield a 0 value disallowing the borrowers to either repay debt or take a loan . 

A Real world scenario :User A wants to borrow 1000 USDC(1 USDC=1e6) so when scaling the amount ,it computes the amount/Scale ,above I pointed the fact that the scale of USDC :1e12 ,1e6/1e12 would result to a decimal less than 1 and solidity would round down the value to the nearest whole number which would yield 0.  

## Impact:As this bug is not exploitable by a malicious user. This bug would result in the dysfunctionality of the pools with either Quote Tokens or Collateral Tokens that fits the criteria(Tokens with decimals less than 9 ).

/**amountToBorrow_ = _roundToScale(
            amountToBorrow_,
            poolState.quoteTokenScale
        );

## Recommendation:To mitigate this issue I recommend multiplication before division.
