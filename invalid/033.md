# Lack of Error Handling in approveLPTransferors function
## Summary
The code doesn't include any error handling or checks for situations where the allowances_[transferors_[i]] is already true. If the function is intended to allow setting allowances only if they are not already set, then it should include error handling or checks to prevent re-approval of the same address twice or more.
## Vulnerability Detail

`function approveLPTransferors(
        mapping(address => bool) storage allowances_,
        address[] calldata transferors_
    ) external  {
        uint256 transferorsLength = transferors_.length;
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < transferorsLength; ) {
            allowances_[transferors_[i]] = true;
            unchecked { ++i; }
        }
        emit ApproveLPTransferors(
            msg.sender,
            transferors_
        );
    }
`

## Impact
This can lead to reapproval of addresses that already have allowances set to true.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the code to check the current value of allowances_[transferors_[i]] before setting it to true. If it's already true, you may want to revert the transaction or handle it as shown below

`function approveLPTransferors(
    mapping(address => bool) storage allowances_,
    address[] calldata transferors_
) external {
    uint256 transferorsLength = transferors_.length;
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < transferorsLength; i++) {
        if (!allowances_[transferors_[i]]) {
            allowances_[transferors_[i]] = true;
        }
    }
    emit ApproveLPTransferors(
        msg.sender,
        transferors_
    );
}`

In the code above it only sets allowances_[transferors_[i]] to true if it's currently false. This prevents reapproval of addresses that already have allowances set to true.
