# Attacker can DoS new ERC20Pool initialization
## Summary
An attacker can DoS new ERC20Pool initialization by calling ```ERC20Pool.initialize(uint256)``` on newly deployed ERC20Pool clone by ERC20PoolFactory.

## Vulnerability Detail
New ERC20Pool clones are created in the ERC20PoolFactory constructor, but states variables are only intialized later  by calling ```ERC20PoolFactory.deployPool(address, address, uint256)```. This call will set the ERC20Pool clone state variables and can only be called once.
The problem is ```ERC20Pool.initialize(uint256)``` access control is external so attacker can call it before it's called by ```ERC20PoolFactory.deployPool(address, address, uint256)``` and it will set ```isPoolInitialized``` state variables to true.
When ```isPoolInitialized``` is true, nobody can ever call it again
- This will DoS new ERC20Pool initialization.

## Impact
New ERC20Pool clones can not be initialized

## Recommendation
as new Clones are deployed into  ERC20PoolFactory constructor, ERC20Pool.initialize() should also be called inside the constructor to initialize the new clone state variables.
