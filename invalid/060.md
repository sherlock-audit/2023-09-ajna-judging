# Vulnerability in the _removeAuction function when removing an auction from the queue if the borrower is both the head and tail of the queue.
## Summary
When removing auction, if borrower is both head and tail, it sets both to 0.  This is a bug that can corrupt the auction queue state, and it should set tail to head rather than 0 when removing the only auction.
## Vulnerability Detail
there is a bug in the _removeAuction function when removing an auction where the borrower is both the head and tail of the queue. Specifically, this code:

      if (auctions_.head == borrower_ && auctions_.tail == borrower_) {
        // liquidation is the head and tail
        auctions_.head = address(0);
       auctions_.tail = address(0); 
     }

Sets both the head and tail to 0 if the borrower is the only auction in the queue. This would effectively erase the auction queue.
The impact of this is that if there is only one auction in the queue and it gets removed, the queue will be corrupted and any subsequent auctions added would not be tracked properly.


## Impact
If there is only one auction in the queue, and that auction is removed, it will set both the head and tail to 0, essentially corrupting the queue's state.
This can cause issues when trying to add new auctions to the queue, as there would be no valid head/tail to append to. It also breaks the invariant that head/tail should always point to a valid auction if there are any auctions in the queue.
So in summary:
• Severity is high since it breaks the core auction queue.
• It can lead to runtime errors and failures when interacting with the auction queue.
• The auction queue state becomes corrupted.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When removing the only auction, tail should be set to head instead of 0:

      if (auctions_.head == borrower_ && auctions_.tail == borrower_) {
        auctions_.head = address(0);  
        auctions_.tail = auctions_.head; 
      }

This preserves the linked list by pointing tail to head (which is 0). With this fix, the auction queue remains usable after removing the last auction. 

In summary -  `auctions_.tail = address(0)` should be changed to `auctions_.tail = auctions_.head`
