# Rebasing tokens are lost in the pool
## Summary
If an Ajna pool is used with rebasing tokens as collateral, the rebase is lost forever.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a rebasing token is used as collateral the rebase stays in the pool but it's not tracked, losing it.
The good thing is that rebasings done as quote tokens, increase reserves and it's not lost.

An expansion of this issue is donations, every token which is transferred to the pool which is not use as quote token will be lost forever inside the pool.

## Tool used
Brownie for testing

## Recommendation

It would be nice to add a functionality to start an auction of untracked tokens for ajna in a similar way `reserveAuction()` works.
