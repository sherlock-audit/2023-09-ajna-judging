# Division by Zero in ``wdiv``, ``ceilWdiv``, ``floorWdiv``, ``ceilDiv`` function
## Summary
"Division by Zero" vulnerability in the code.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability involves a division operation in the code where the divisor may be zero. Division by zero is an undefined mathematical operation and can lead to runtime exceptions, program crashes, and unexpected behavior in the software. This can occur when the divisor is not properly validated before the division operation is executed.

## Impact
Division by zero can have significant consequences, including program termination or crashes. In certain cases, it can lead to incorrect results and unexpected behavior, which may impact the functionality and reliability of the software. In some situations, it can even be exploited by attackers to compromise the application's stability or security.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Maths.sol#L26

```solidity
function wdiv(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return (x * WAD + y / 2) / y;
}
```

        return (x * WAD) / y;
}
```

```solidity

        return (x * WAD + y - 1) / y;
}
```

```solidity

        return (x + y - 1) / y;
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate the division by zero vulnerability, it is recommended to implement proper checks and validation before performing division operations. Before dividing a value by another, ensure that the divisor is not zero. You can use conditional statements or the ``require`` statement to validate the divisor before performing the division. Additionally, consider providing appropriate error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle such cases, rather than causing program crashes or unexpected behavior.

```solidity
function wdiv(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    require(y > 0, "Division by zero in wdiv");
    return (x * WAD + y / 2) / y;
}

function floorWdiv(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    require(y > 0, "Division by zero in floorWdiv");
    return (x * WAD) / y;
}

function ceilWdiv(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    require(y > 0, "Division by zero in ceilWdiv");
    return (x * WAD + y - 1) / y;
}

function ceilDiv(uint256 x, uint256 y) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    require(y > 0, "Division by zero in ceilDiv");
    return (x + y - 1) / y;
}
```
