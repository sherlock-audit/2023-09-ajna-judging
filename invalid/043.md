# If a bucket goes bankrupt, the bankruptcyTime is updated but previously deposited LP is still valid.
## Summary
If a bucket goes bankrupt, the bankruptcyTime is updated but previously deposited LP is still valid. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Previously deposited LP remains valid after a bucket bankruptcy in Pools.

Here is how it works:

When a bucket goes bankrupt, the bankruptcyTime is set to the current block timestamp:

      bucket.bankruptcyTime = block.timestamp;

When depositing or withdrawing from a bucket, the deposit is valid if the depositTime is before the bankruptcyTime:

      if (bucket.bankruptcyTime < depositTime) {
        // deposit is valid
      }

So any deposits made before the bankruptcy remain valid and can still be withdrawn after bankruptcy.
The impact is that LPs don't immediately lose their deposits if a bucket goes bankrupt. This prevents unfair loss of funds.
However, it also means that insolvent buckets can continue to be withdrawn from, potentially draining collateral from other buckets.

## Impact
This can result in a significant loss for lenders who had LP tokens in the bankrupt bucket.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract could invalidate all LP in a bucket when it goes bankrupt, forcing LPs to withdraw before bankruptcy:
• Set lender.lps = 0 when bankruptcyTime is updated
• Remove the depositTime check when redeeming
• This burns all remaining LP in the bankrupt bucket
So LPs are incentivized to monitor buckets and withdraw if risky, rather than relying on previously deposited LP remaining valid after bankruptcy.
