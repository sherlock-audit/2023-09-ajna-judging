# Lack of validation for the ``spender_`` contract
## Summary
The security issue pertains to the lack of validation for the ``spender_`` contract's validity in the ``permit`` function in the source code.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the ``permit`` function, there is no validation of the ``spender_`` contract's validity before delegating permission to it. This may allow the caller to delegate control to a malicious contract that could perform undesired actions on NFTs.

## Impact
- Risk to NFT owners, as they may delegate control of their NFTs to unsafe contracts.
- Potential loss or unauthorized use of cryptocurrency or digital assets of users.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/base/PermitERC721.sol#L143

```solidity
function permit(
    address spender_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 deadline_,
    bytes memory signature_
) external {
    // ...
    
    // approve the spender for accessing the tokenId
    _approve(spender_, tokenId_);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this issue, it is crucial to perform validation for the spender_ contract's validity before delegating permission to it. You should use functions to validate the address and contract's legitimacy before allowing permission, ensuring that only safe and authorized contracts can make changes to the NFTs.

```solidity
function permit(
    address spender_,
    uint256 tokenId_,
    uint256 deadline_,
    bytes memory signature_
) external {
    if ( spender_ == address(0) ) revert DeployWithZeroAddress();
    
    // approve the spender for accessing the tokenId
    _approve(spender_, tokenId_);
}
```
