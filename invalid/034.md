# return value of call to read-only functions is not checked
## Summary
return value of call is not checked.
## Vulnerability Detail
The return value of the calls to read-only functions in  `PoolInfoUtilsMulticall.multicall()`  is not checked, so if the call fails, the contract just assumes that they were successful, this breaks the efficiency of `PoolInfoUtilsMulticall.multicall()` function.

## Impact
The function won't be effective in aggregating results from multiple read-only function calls because the contract will assume all calls were successful when in fact some could fail.
