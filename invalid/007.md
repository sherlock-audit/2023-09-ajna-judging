# Uncontrolled token minting vulnerability
## Summary
The unrestricted increment of the _nextId variable, allowing malicious actors to continuously call the function and potentially exhaust resources, causing the `_nextId` variable to increment continuously until it reaches the upper limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mint()` function is used to create new tokens and assigning them to specific recipients within a specified pool. Inside the function, the protocol generates a new token ID (tokenId_) that is assigned to the caller. The token ID is obtained by incrementing the `_nextId` variable.The `tokenId_` is of type uint176, and a security concern arises from the fact that bad actors can repeatedly call the `mint()` function, causing the `_nextId` variable to increment continuously until it reaches the upper limit.
```solidity
function mint(
        address pool_,
        address recipient_,
        bytes32 poolSubsetHash_
    ) external override nonReentrant returns (uint256 tokenId_) {
        // revert if the address is not a valid Ajna pool
        if (!_isAjnaPool(pool_, poolSubsetHash_)) revert NotAjnaPool();

        tokenId_ = _nextId++;

        // record which pool the tokenId was minted in
        positionTokens[tokenId_].pool = pool_;

        _mint(recipient_, tokenId_);

        emit Mint(recipient_, pool_, tokenId_);
    }

```

## Impact
Mint function will become unavailable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is essential to implement proper access control and checks within the mint function.
