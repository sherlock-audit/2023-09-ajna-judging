# Unbounded Auction Price Decrease Leads to Lending Pool Insolvency
## Summary
When a borrower cannot pay their debt in an ERC20 pool, their position is liquidated and their assets enter an auction for other users to purchase small pieces of their assets. Because of the incentive that users wish to not pay above the standard market price for a token, users will generally wait until assets on auction are as cheap as possible to purchase however, this is flawed because this guarantees a loss for all lenders participating in the protocol with each user that is liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a situation where a user decides to short a coin through a loan and refuses to take the loss to retain the value of their position. When the auction is kicked off using the `kick()` function on this user, as time moves forward, the price for puchasing these assets becomes increasingly cheaper. These prices can fall through the floor price of the lending pool which will allow anybody to buy tokens for only a fraction of what they were worth originally leading to a state where the pool cant cover the debt of the user who has not paid their loan back with interest. The issue lies in the `_auctionPrice()` function of the `Auctions.sol` contract which calculates the price of the auctioned assets for the taker. This function does not consider the floor price of the pool. The proof of concept below outlines this scenario:

## Impact
An increase in borrowers who cant pay their debts back will result in a loss for all lenders.

## Tool used

Manual Review + in-house tool

## Recommendation
It's recommended that the price of the assets on auction consider the fenwick(s) being used when determining the price of assets on loan and do not fall below that particular index. With this fix in place, the worst case scenario is that lenders can purchase these assets for the price they were loaned out for allowing them to recover the loss.
