# Malicious actor can manipulate interest rates by calling updateInterestState more frequently than once every 12 hours
## Summary
There is an assumption that this function will not be called more than once every 12 hours. However, there is no enforcement of this in the contract. A malicious actor could call it more frequently to manipulate interest rates. 
## Vulnerability Detail
It is possible for a malicious actor to call updateInterestState() more frequently than every 12 hours to manipulate interest rates, since there is no enforcement of the 12 hour limit.
The key parts of the code are:
1. updateInterestState() calculates new EMA values and interest rate params. It saves them to storage.
2. It only calculates a new interest rate if more than 12 hours have passed since the last update:

          if (block.timestamp - interestParams_.interestRateUpdate > 12 hours) {
            // calculate and update interest rate 
          }

3. There is no check to prevent updateInterestState() from being called more often than every 12 hours.

A malicious actor could exploit this by:
• Calling updateInterestState() more often than every 12 hours.
• This would repeatedly recalculate the EMAs and interest rate params.
• By manipulating the frequency of calls, they could game the EMA calculations to artificially alter the interest rate.

For example, they could briefly increase utilization right before the calls to increase the rate, then decrease utilization to lower the rate. By timing the changes and calls, they could trick the EMAs and get an incorrectly high or low rate.
This could negatively impact other users by manipulating rates for the attacker's benefit.

## Impact
The vulnerability of calling this function more frequently than intended is that it could allow malicious actors to manipulate interest rates in the pool.
Specifically, by calling updateInterestState() more often than once every 12 hours, attackers could:
• Artificially increase interest rates by repeatedly calling updateInterestRate() and triggering the rate increase logic. This would improperly charge higher interest rates to borrowers.
• Artificially suppress interest rates by calling updateInterestRate() before natural rate increases happen. This would improperly benefit borrowers by charging lower rates.
This is a moderate severity issue. While it does allow manipulation of a key economic parameter of the pool, there are some mitigating factors:

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract should add a lastUpdate timestamp and require at least 12 hours to have passed since the last call. A suggestive example:

      uint256 public lastUpdate; 

      function updateInterestState() external {

       require(block.timestamp - lastUpdate > 12 hours, "Must wait 12 hours between updates");
  
       // update interest state

       lastUpdate = block.timestamp;

      }

This would prevent the attacker from calling it more often than once per 12 hours.
