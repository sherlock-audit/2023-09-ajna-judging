# Flawed DWATP calculation may lead to inaccurate interest rate due to not accounting for changing collateral
## Summary

Adding / removing collateral via the `addCollateral` and `removeCollateral` functions does not update the `t0Debt2ToCollateral` ratio, which may lead to inaccurate calculations of the Target Utilization and interest rates.

## Vulnerability Detail

A pool's DWATP is the average threshold price of all loans in the pool, weighted by the debt of the loan. This value is used to calculate a pool's target utilization, which in turn affects the pool's interest rate. To ease the calculation of the DWATP, the code tracks in state the [`interestState.t0Debt2ToCollateral` variable](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L102). Which, [according to the documentation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L641), is to be updated accordingly whenever a borrower's debt or collateral changes.

The function to execute the update is [`Pool::_updateT0Debt2ToCollateral`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L649). For example, it's called whenever debt is drawn or repaid (see the [`ERC20Pool::repayDebt`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L240) and [`ERC20Pool::drawDebt`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L164) functions), during liquidations (see [`Pool::kick`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L304) ) and settling auctions (see [`Pool::_updatePostTakeState`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L600)). Interestingly, all calls to `_updateT0Debt2ToCollateral` (which [update the `t0Debt2ToCollateral`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/base/Pool.sol#L663) state variable) are followed by the appropriate call to `Pool::_updateInterestState`, which [reads from the updated `t0Debt2ToCollateral`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/PoolCommons.sol#L97) state variable.

However, while the `addCollateral` and `removeCollateral` functions update a borrower's collateral, they _do not_ update the `t0Debt2ToCollateral`  variable. That is, they never call the `Pool::_updateT0Debt2ToCollateral` with the new collateral values. But still update the interest rate with calls to `Pool::_updateInterestState`, which will use an outdated `t0Debt2ToCollateral` value.

## Impact

As a result of this flaw, collateral changes that occur via the `addCollateral` function ([from `ERC20Pool`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/ERC20Pool.sol#L281) and [`ERC721Pool`](https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-05-ajna/blob/276942bc2f97488d07b887c8edceaaab7a5c3964/ajna-core/src/ERC721Pool.sol#L288))  (as well as the corresponding `removeCollateral` functions) may not be correctly accounted to calculate the DWATP, which may lead to miscalculating the real interest rate of the pool.

## Recommendation

To abide to the documentation of the `_updateT0Debt2ToCollateral` function and avoid miscalculations of the DWATP, make sure that all functions that change a borrower's collateral correctly update the `t0Debt2ToCollateral` variable. This includes the `addCollateral` and `removeCollateral` functions. You can do this by calling the `Pool::_updateT0Debt2ToCollateral` function before updating the interest rate with `Pool::_updateInterestState`.
