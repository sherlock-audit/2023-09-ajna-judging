# An attacker could collude with the old owner to set an artificially early depositTime, which would then get adopted by the new owner.
## Summary
The new owner's depositTime is set to the max of the old owner's depositTime and the new owner's existing depositTime. This assumes the old owner's depositTime is valid. An attacker could collude with the old owner to set an artificially early depositTime and get it adopted by the new owner. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The key parts are:
1. The old owner's `depositTime` is read from storage without validation:

         uint256 ownerDepositTime = owner.depositTime;

2. The new owner's `depositTime` is updated to the max of this and their existing `depositTime`:

         newOwner.depositTime = Maths.max(ownerDepositTime, newOwnerDepositTime);

This means the old owner can artificially set a low `depositTime` by directly writing to storage. For example:

      owner.depositTime = 1; // set to block 1

When their LP is transferred, this invalid early `depositTime` will be adopted by the new owner.
This allows the new owner to circumvent the bankruptcy `depositTime` checks and withdraw more assets than they should be able to.
For example, if a bankruptcy happened at block 1000, the new owner should only be able to withdraw LP deposited after block 1000. But with the artificially low `depositTime` of 1, they can withdraw all their LP.

## Impact
The main impact of an attacker colluding with the old owner to set an artificially early depositTime is that it could allow the new owner to wrongly claim LPs in a bucket that suffered bankruptcy. This is because the new owner's LPs are protected from bankruptcy if their deposit happened after the bankruptcy.
By adopting the old owner's artificially early depositTime, the new owner could falsely claim their deposit happened before the bankruptcy, when in reality it happened after. This would allow them to redeem more LPs than they are entitled to.
The severity of this issue is high. It directly impacts the solvency and integrity of the lending pool by allowing LPs to be redeemed improperly. At a minimum it results in loss of funds for other LPs in the affected buckets. In an extreme case it could lead to insolvency of the pool if enough LPs are wrongly redeemed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation 
The old owner's depositTime should be validated before assigning it to the new owner in ways that prevents the old owner from setting an invalid early depositTime that gets inherited by the new owner.
