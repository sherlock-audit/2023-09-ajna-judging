# Only considering change in debt to update the t0Debt2ToCollateral ratio is incorrect. If collateral changes without debt changing, the state would not be updated properly. This can lead to an inaccurate t0Debt2ToCollateral ratio.
## Summary
The logic only considers change in debt to update the ratio. If collateral changed without debt changing, the logic would miss updating the state. Should calculate ratio before and after even if only collateral changed


## Vulnerability Detail
Logic in _updateT0Debt2ToCollateral() only considers changes in debt when updating the t0Debt2ToCollateral ratio, and would miss updating the state if only collateral changed
Only considering debt change to update the debt-to-collateral ratio is problematic. If collateral changes without debt changing, the ratio should still be updated.
The main issue is in the _updateT0Debt2ToCollateral function:

      function _updateT0Debt2ToCollateral(
          uint256 debtPreAction_, 
          uint256 debtPostAction_,
          uint256 colPreAction_,
          uint256 colPostAction_
      ) internal {

        uint256 debt2ColAccumPreAction  = colPreAction_ != 0 ? debtPreAction_ ** 2 / colPreAction_ : 0;
        uint256 debt2ColAccumPostAction = colPostAction_ != 0 ? debtPostAction_ ** 2 / colPostAction_ : 0;

        if (debt2ColAccumPreAction != 0 || debt2ColAccumPostAction != 0) {
          // update ratio
        }

      }
It only updates the ratio if either the pre or post debt values are non-zero. This misses cases where only collateral changed.
For example, say originally:
• Debt: 100
• Collateral: 200
• Ratio: 100^2/200 = 0.5
Now collateral is doubled to 400, but debt stays the same:
• Debt: 100
• Collateral: 400
• Ratio: 100^2/400 = 0.25
But since debt didn't change, _updateT0Debt2ToCollateral won't update the ratio.
The vulnerability is that the debt-to-collateral ratio can become incorrect, leading to improper interest rate calculations.



## Impact
The debt-to-collateral ratio stored in the contract will be incorrect if collateral is changed without changing debt. This could lead to several issues like  Inaccurate interest rate, risk of undercollateralization inefficient liquidations 
I would categorize this as a high severity issue. An incorrect debt-to-collateral ratio fundamentally undermines the risk model and incentives of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
_updateT0Debt2ToCollateral should always calculate and update the ratio, regardless of debt change:

      function _updateT0Debt2ToCollateral(
        uint256 debtPreAction_, 
        uint256 debtPostAction_,
        uint256 colPreAction_,
        uint256 colPostAction_  
      ) internal {

        uint256 debt2ColAccumPreAction = colPreAction_ != 0 ? debtPreAction_ ** 2 / colPreAction_ : 0;
        uint256 debt2ColAccumPostAction = colPostAction_ != 0 ? debtPostAction_ ** 2 / colPostAction_ : 0;
  
        // Always update ratio
       uint256 curRatio = interestState.t0Debt2ToCollateral;
       curRatio -= debt2ColAccumPreAction; 
       curRatio += debt2ColAccumPostAction;

       interestState.t0Debt2ToCollateral = curRatio;

      }
This ensures the ratio gets updated correctly in all cases, whether debt changes or not.
