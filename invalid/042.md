# Depositing below the LUP can still increase the LUP if it fills up lower bucket
## Summary
The lup_ price is only recalculated if the deposit is above the previous lup. This ignores the case where a deposit below lup could still increase lup if it fills up lower buckets
## Vulnerability Detail
A deposit below the previous LUP can still increase LUP if it fills up lower buckets
The key things to understand here:
• LUP (Last Utilized Price) is the highest bucket price that is fully utilized (deposit = bucket size).
• It is recalculated whenever deposits change.
• Deposits are stored in a Fenwick tree data structure. This allows efficiently querying prefix sums.
In the addQuoteToken function, LUP is only recalculated if the deposit is above the previous LUP:

      if (!depositBelowLup) {
        lupIndex = Deposits.findIndexOfSum(deposits_, poolState_.debt); 
      }
      lup_ = _priceAt(lupIndex);

This misses the case where a deposit below LUP could increase LUP.
For example:
• Bucket 1 (price 100) is full
• Bucket 2 (price 90) has free capacity
• Current LUP is 100
• A deposit is made in Bucket 2
• The new LUP should be 90 but it is not recalculated

## Impact
The major impact is that the LUP price reported could be inaccurate and too low if deposits are made below the previous LUP. This could allow loans to be taken out at interest rates that are too low relative to the actual liquidity available in the pool.

An incorrectly low LUP could allow loans to be created at unsafe ratios and put the protocol at risk. 

If a significant amount of deposits are below LUP, then the reported LUP could diverge significantly from the actual liquidity-adjusted LUP.

This could enable arbitrage opportunities for borrowers if they can borrow at rates that are too low relative to liquidity. It could also lead to problems if the inaccurate LUP allows loans to be taken out that couldn't actually be covered by the available liquidity.

Overall I would categorize this as a high severity issue since it directly impacts the core LUP mechanic for adjusting interest rates. The code should recalculate LUP anytime new deposits are made, regardless of whether they are above or below the previous LUP

## Recommendation
To fix this, LUP should always be recalculated after a deposit. A suggestive example:

      // Recalculate LUP after any deposit
      lupIndex = Deposits.findIndexOfSum(deposits_, poolState_.debt);
      lup_ = _priceAt(lupIndex);

This ensures LUP accurately reflects the last fully utilized bucket after any changes to deposits.
