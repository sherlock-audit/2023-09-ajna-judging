# Unchecked return value for low level call in multicall function
## Summary
Low-level calls will never throw an exception, instead they will return false if they encounter an exception, whereas contract calls will automatically throw.

## Vulnerability Detail
If the return value of a low-level message call is not checked then the execution will resume even if the called contract throws an exception. If the call fails accidentally or an attacker forces the call to fail, then this may cause unexpected behavior in the subsequent program logic.

In the case that you use low-level calls, be sure to check the return value to handle possible failed calls.

## Impact
Unchecked returns can cause unexpected behavior,

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/PoolInfoUtilsMulticall.sol?plain=1#L168
```solidity
            (, results_[i]) = address(poolInfoUtils).call(callData);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure that the return value of a low-level call is checked or logged.
```solidity
(bool success, results_[i]) = address(poolInfoUtils).call(callData);
require(success);
```
