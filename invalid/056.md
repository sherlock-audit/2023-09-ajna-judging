# The _lenderInterestMargin function has a special case that bypasses the main calculation logic when the base variable is less than 1e18. This allows for manipulations
## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
 The _lenderInterestMargin function has special case logic that bypasses the main calculation when base < 1e18.

Here is the relevant code:


      function _lenderInterestMargin(uint256 mau_) internal pure returns (uint256) {

        uint256 base = 1_000_000 * 1e18 - Maths.min(mau_, 1e18) * 1_000_000;

        if (base < 1e18) {
          return 1e18; 
        }

        // main calculation logic
        uint256 crpud = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(base, ONE_THIRD);
        return 1e18 - Maths.wdiv(Maths.wmul(crpud, 0.15 * 1e18), CUBIC_ROOT_1000000);

      }
When base < 1e18, it directly returns 1e18, bypassing the main calculation.

This means that if base is a very small number, close to 0, the lender interest margin will be set to 1e18 (100%) regardless of the actual inputs.

This could allow an attacker to manipulate the inputs to make base artificially small, resulting in lenders getting 100% of the interest and maximizing returns.
## Impact
The vulnerability of the special case when base < 1e18 is that it results in lenders getting 100% of the interest, bypassing the normal calculation logic.
This could be a high severity issue because:
• It diverges from the intended interest sharing logic based on utilization. Lenders get 100% of interest regardless of utilization.
• It could incentivize manipulative behavior to force base < 1e18. For example, borrowers paying back debt to reduce utilization right before interest accrual.
• It likely disproportionately benefits lenders over borrowers.
• It removes the equilibrium incentives that tie lender returns to utilization. Lenders no longer have incentive to limit deposits when utilization is low.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
 I would recommend removing the special case and forcing the calculation to run normally even for small base values. A suggestive example:

      function _lenderInterestMargin(uint256 mau_) internal pure returns (uint256) {

        uint256 base = 1_000_000 * 1e18 - Maths.min(mau_, 1e18) * 1_000_000;
  
        // remove special case logic
  
        uint256 crpud = PRBMathUD60x18.pow(base, ONE_THIRD);
        return 1e18 - Maths.wdiv(Maths.wmul(crpud, 0.15 * 1e18), CUBIC_ROOT_1000000);

      }

This ensures the logic cannot be bypassed and the calculation behaves as expected even for small base values close to 0.
