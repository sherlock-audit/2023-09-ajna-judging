# Invalid ``sumIndex_`` Boundary Check
## Summary
The code has a security vulnerability that allows for potential out-of-bounds access to arrays, leading to potential memory issues and unexpected behavior.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided code, there is a lack of proper boundary checks when accessing arrays, specifically when working with the ``deposits_.values`` and ``deposits_.scaling`` arrays. The variable ``sumIndex_`` is used to index these arrays without prior verification, which can lead to out-of-bounds access if ``sumIndex_`` exceeds the array size.

## Impact
The potential impact of this vulnerability includes:

- Unauthorized access to memory, leading to unexpected behavior or data corruption.
- Possible denial-of-service (DoS) attacks by intentionally manipulating ``sumIndex_`` to exceed array bounds.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/internal/Deposits.sol#L97-L132

```solidity
...
 while (i > 0) {
            // Consider if the target index is less than or greater than sumIndex_ + i
            curIndex = sumIndex_ + i;
            value    = deposits_.values[curIndex];
            scaling  = deposits_.scaling[curIndex];
...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to add boundary checks to ensure that ``sumIndex_`` does not exceed the array size (``MAX_FENWICK_INDEX``) before accessing ``deposits_.values`` and ``deposits_.scaling``. You can use a require statement to enforce this check. 

```solidity
...
while (i > 0) {
    curIndex = sumIndex_ + i;

    // Add the boundary check here
    require(curIndex <= MAX_FENWICK_INDEX, "Invalid sumIndex_");

    value = deposits_.values[curIndex];
    scaling = deposits_.scaling[curIndex];

    // ...

    i = i >> 1;
}
```
