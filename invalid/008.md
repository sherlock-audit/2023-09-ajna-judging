# Functions lack reentrancy protection
## Summary
Functions lack reentrancy protection
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol lacks proper reentrancy protection in many of its functions, such as redeemPositions() and memorializePositions(). This deficiency poses a significant security concern. Without adequate reentrancy protection, the protocol becomes vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, where malicious actors can potentially exploit these functions to execute unintended and potentially harmful actions.
```solidity
function redeemPositions(
        address pool_,
        uint256 tokenId_,
        uint256[] calldata indexes_
    ) external override mayInteract(pool_, tokenId_) {
        TokenInfo storage tokenInfo = positionTokens[tokenId_];

        IPool pool = IPool(pool_);

        // local vars used in for loop for reduced gas
        uint256 index;
        uint256 indexesLength = indexes_.length;
        uint256[] memory lpAmounts = new uint256[](indexesLength);

        // retrieve LP amounts from each bucket index associated with token id
        for (uint256 i = 0; i < indexesLength; ) {
            index = indexes_[i];

            Position memory position = tokenInfo.positions[index];

            if (position.lps == 0 || position.depositTime == 0) revert RemovePositionFailed();

            // check that bucket didn't go bankrupt after memorialization
            if (_bucketBankruptAfterDeposit(pool, index, position.depositTime)) revert BucketBankrupt();

            // remove bucket index at which a position has added liquidity
            if (!tokenInfo.positionIndexes.remove(index)) revert RemovePositionFailed();

            lpAmounts[i] = position.lps;

            // remove LP tracked by position manager at bucket index
            delete tokenInfo.positions[index];

            unchecked { ++i; }
        }

        address owner = ownerOf(tokenId_);

        // approve owner to take over the LP ownership (required for transferLP pool call)
        pool.increaseLPAllowance(owner, indexes_, lpAmounts);
        // update pool lps accounting and transfer ownership of lps from PositionManager contract
        pool.transferLP(address(this), owner, indexes_);

        emit RedeemPosition(owner, tokenId_, indexes_);
    }
```
