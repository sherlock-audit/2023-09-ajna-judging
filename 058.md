# There is a bug in the _settlePoolDebtWithDeposit function where it double counts the borrower's debt when calculating assets to settle with reserves
## Summary
When settling with reserves, it calculates assets by adding t0Debt and poolBalance. However, t0Debt already includes the borrower's debt, so this is double counting. Double counting the borrower's debt leads to incorrectly estimating assets and creates a vulnerability. 
## Vulnerability Detail
There is a bug in the _settlePoolDebtWithDeposit function where it double counts the borrower's debt when calculating the pool's assets.
Specifically, in this section:

      // 2. settle debt with pool reserves
      uint256 assets = Maths.floorWmul(poolState_.t0Debt - result_.t0DebtSettled + borrower.t0Debt, poolState_.inflator) + 
       params_.poolBalance;

It is adding `poolState_.t0Debt` and `borrower.t0Debt` together. However, `poolState_.t0Debt` already includes the total debt of all borrowers, including the `borrower.t0Debt` being settled. So this is double counting the borrower's debt.

The vulnerability of this bug is that it will overestimate the assets available in the pool reserves to settle the debt. This means it could incorrectly settle more debt than the reserves can actually cover.

## Impact
It will overestimate the assets available in the pool to settle debt, potentially settling more debt from the reserves than is actually available. The severity is high since it impacts the accuracy of the reserves and could put the pool stability at risk if abused.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It should calculate assets using only the pool balance, without adding the borrower's debt again:

      uint256 assets = params_.poolBalance;

Or if you want to exclude the borrower's settled debt so far from reserves:

      uint256 assets = Maths.floorWmul(poolState_.t0Debt - result_.t0DebtSettled, poolState_.inflator) + params_.poolBalance;

This fixes the double counting and accurately calculates the reserves available to settle the borrower's remaining debt.
