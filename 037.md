# No Recovery Time for Borrowers In Auction Kick
## Summary
The vulnerability strips borrowers of the promised opportunity to react within the one-hour grace period when their loan enters liquidation `auction kick`. Due to the immediate \_inAuction check, borrowers have no time to recover, potentially resulting losses for them.
## Vulnerability Detail
- In the _whitepaper_, it's stated that borrowers should have the ability to pay off their debt at any time. Additionally, the _whitepaper_ claims that if a `borrower` get `kicked`, there is a one-hour grace period for the borrower to potentially recollateralize their loan.
- > The first hour of liquidation is a grace period in which the borrower may recapitalize or pay back their loan ... </br>

- However, this is not the case. When a borrower is kicked into the auction, they cannot repay or add more collateral to their debt due to the `inAuction` check at the beginning of the `drawDebt` and `repayDebt` functions. This situation is unfair as it allows lenders to `kick` a loan without giving the borrower a chance to pay off their debt,only through auction. which causes lose for him.this discouraging borrowers to borrow.
## Impact
- denies borrowers the crucial recovery window during auction kicks, leading to immediate liquidation risks and substantial financial losses.
## Code Snippet

- To add more collateral and maintain a healthy position, the borrower can use the `drawDebt` function. However, the current implementation does not allow this if the borrower is in an active auction: .
```solidity
 function drawDebt(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        DepositsState storage deposits_,
        LoansState    storage loans_,
        PoolState calldata poolState_,
        uint256 maxAvailable_,
        address borrowerAddress_,
        uint256 amountToBorrow_,
        uint256 limitIndex_,
        uint256 collateralToPledge_
    ) external returns (
        DrawDebtResult memory result_
    ) {
        // revert if not enough pool balance to borrow
        if (amountToBorrow_ > maxAvailable_) revert InsufficientLiquidity();
        // revert if borrower is in auction
       if(_inAuction(auctions_, borrowerAddress_)) revert AuctionActive();
        //........
    }
```

- To repay debt and maintain a healthy position, the borrower can use the `repayDebt` function. However, similar to `drawDebt`, this function also does not allow repayment if the borrower is in an active auction:
```solidity
  function repayDebt(
          AuctionsState storage auctions_,
          DepositsState storage deposits_,
          LoansState    storage loans_,
          PoolState calldata poolState_,
          address borrowerAddress_,
          uint256 maxQuoteTokenAmountToRepay_,
          uint256 collateralAmountToPull_,
          uint256 limitIndex_
      ) external returns (
          RepayDebtResult memory result_
      ) {
          RepayDebtLocalVars memory vars;
          vars.repay = maxQuoteTokenAmountToRepay_ != 0;
          vars.pull  = collateralAmountToPull_     != 0;

         
          if (!vars.repay && !vars.pull) revert InvalidAmount()
    
        if(_inAuction(auctions_, borrowerAddress_)) revert AuctionActive();

          Borrower memory borrower = loans_.borrowers[borrowerAddress_];
      }
```
- https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-09-ajna/blob/main/ajna-core/src/libraries/external/BorrowerActions.sol#L388
- this prevent the previous function from execute if the borrower already in auction.from the first second the loan of a borrower get `kicked` to the auction. leaving no time for the borrower to react and pay their debt:

```solidity
   function _inAuction(
        AuctionsState storage auctions_,
        address borrower_
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        return auctions_.liquidations[borrower_].kickTime != 0;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- allow borrowers that get kicked in less then one hour before. to repay debt and remove them from auction.
