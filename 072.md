# Remove custom function allowance
## Summary
The increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions can add more bugs.

## Vulnerability Detail
Recently, the increaseAllowance function has been removed from the OpenZeppelin ERC20 contract due to its exploitation in phishing attacks and to prevent the possibility of further phishing attacks. 

See https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/4583.  We should remove the functions increaseLPAllowance and decreaseLPAllowance as they only solve an imaginary problem.

These functions are not part of the EIP-20 specs.

## Impact
Using these functions will result in unexpected behaviour which will cause contracts to become corrupted.

These functions may allow for further phishing possibilities.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
considering removing increaseLPAllowance/decreaseLPAllowance function from LPActions contract.

Or implement a function similar to this [SafeERC20](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/60e3ffe6a3cc38ab94cae995bc1de081eed79335/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol#L48-L69) library which is still available.
