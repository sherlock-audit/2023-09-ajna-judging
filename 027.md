# No Access Control In IPool transferFrom function
## Summary
The transferFrom function does not check whether the address of the owner is from msg.sender.
## Vulnerability Detail
Lack of ownership verification allows anyone to call the transferFrom function and transfer tokens from any account, not just their own. This means that an attacker can transfer tokens from other users' accounts without their consent.

interface IERC20Token {
    function balanceOf(address account) external view returns (uint256);
    function burn(uint256 amount) external;
    function decimals() external view returns (uint8);
    function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);
    function transferFrom(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    ) external returns (bool);
}
## Impact
Without checking whether the msg.sender is the actual owner of the tokens, anyone can call the transferFrom function and transfer tokens from someone else's account.

## Recommendation
Include proper checks in the transferFrom function to verify that msg.sender is the owner of the tokens they are trying to transfer.
